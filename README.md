<h2 id="getting-started">üöÄ Getting started</h2>

```sh
npm install -g @txty-io/txty-cli

# or

yarn global add @txty-io/txty-cli
```

and then

```sh
txty -h
```

<h2 id="authentication">üîë Authentication</h2>

The `txty` utility can be configured by placing a `.txty.json` in your home folder.

### Authenticate via global config

The authentication against the Txty server is configured in the global `~/.txty.json` configuration file. Make sure to always keep the global config file private.

Example `~/.txty.json`

```json
{
    "auth_email": "email@example.com",
    "auth_secret": "aG2DzuoWG30a3IHwOKMQUg"
}
```

| Option      | Description                                                                                     | Optional |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| auth_email  | The email you use to log in on Txty.                                                       | No       |
| auth_secret | An access token you can generate at https://app.txty.io/dashboard/settings/access-tokens. | No       |

### Authenticate by passing auth credentials to commands

You can also pass the auth credentials to the CLI tool by adding `--auth-email=<value>` and `--auth-secret=<value>` to your command.

CLI passed auth credentials have precedence over those defined in the global config.

<h2 id="project-config">‚öôÔ∏è Project Config</h2>

It is recommended that you put the project config `txty.json` in the root directory of your project (otherwise you need to set `project_path`).

No sensitive data should be stored in your project config so you can safely check this file in with your code and share it with others.

Example `txty.json`

```json
{
    "api_base_url": "https://app.txty.io/api",
    "api_version": "v1",
    "project_id": "b53faf34-934a-491b-84aa-d880f3c2bce8",
    "export_configuration_id": "9bd1edfc-9d43-449d-9e51-7990630baf74",
    "export_directory": "translations",
    "project_path": ""
}
```

| api_version             | The version of the API (for now only `v1` is available).                                                                     | No       |
